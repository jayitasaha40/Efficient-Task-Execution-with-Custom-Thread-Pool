# Efficient-Task-Execution-with-Custom-Thread-Pool
This implementation demonstrates how to efficiently manage and execute multiple tasks using a custom thread pool backed by a BlockingQueue. Instead of creating a new thread for every task, a fixed number of worker threads continuously fetch and execute tasks from the queue, optimizing resource utilization and improving performance.
